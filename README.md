# Project-2 (Twitter Data Analysis)

## Project Description
Project 2 Analysis was performed on streamed Twitter data using the Spark Framework and SparkSql. Our intended purpose was to answer various questions regarding the conditions under which a user will choose to share their location information with the Twitter application. We utilized both static data that was previously streamed as well as information from other APIs. We also integrated Structured Streaming into our analyses of live tweets in our effort to analyze the conditions under which users will willingly share their location data with the twitter application and by extension the streaming Twitter API.

## Technology used
